					<div class="h-body text-center">
						<p>. Pneumonia is most commonly caused by viruses
							or bacteria and, less commonly, other microorganisms .
							Nowadays, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is used commonly for
							health intensive care and analysis of many lung diseases
							such as pneumonia, cancer because of relatively low prices.
							Therefore, Chest X-rays are currently the best available tool.
                             Data mining is a process that is used to locate correlations
							between data and form pattern of relationships among cluster
							fields in the enormous interactive database (Gary Smith, 2020).
							With data mining techniques, doctors around the world will be able
							to predict illnesses effectively and be better equipped to manage
							potential high-risk candidates. Such analysis and predictions become
							critical if the objective is to provide relief to millions around the world.
